## Description
  
My project is a Bugdet tracker. This project demonstartes the work and effort you need to put in so that you can keep your expense up to date online and offline. While doing this project it let me learn new ways to code and express didnt functions and statment in different ways than I usually would. I have not done any projects used idb where you can you an app with online and offline functions so that was pretty neat.
